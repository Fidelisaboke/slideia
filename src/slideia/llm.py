LLM integration layer for slideia.

This module provides functions to interact with a language model (LLM) for:
- Proposing a slide outline for a given topic, audience, tone, and number of slides.
- Drafting the content of a single slide based on a slide specification.

All functions are placeholders and should be implemented with actual LLM calls in the future.
